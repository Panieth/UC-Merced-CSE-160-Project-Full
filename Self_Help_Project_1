In node.nc: 
        contains 2 parts: module and implementation
        module = list all interfaces to be used in this portion's implementation
        implementation = logic of your code


    TO DO: 
        Use documnetation (TOSSIM  http://cs.jhu.edu/~razvanm/wsn/tos-tutorial-tossim-with-notes.pdf) 
        to figure out what each function/command does (Alternate github link: https://github.com/tinyos/tinyos-main)
        
        create 2 modules. 1 for flooding, 1 for neighbor discovery.

        add to module node "uses interface flooding" && "Uses interface neighbor discovery" (these
        modules will be created elsewhere, they are only called to be used here)


In nodeC.nc:
        contains 2 parts: configuration and implementation
        configuration = declaring you are making a configuration file with name "______"
        implementation = 


    TO 
        Use structure
